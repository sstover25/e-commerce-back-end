# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

## Description

```
The client (a manager at an internet retail company) requested that
back end code be created to work with their e-commerce application.
The application is required to use Sequelize and MySQL. This application
tracks models for Category, Tag, and Product, which all need to relationally
connect. API endpoint calls need to be created so that they can interface
with the front end eventually.
```

## User Story

```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```

and a MySQL password to an environment variable (.env) file and is
the able to connect to the database using Sequelize.

- It is done when the user enters schema and seed commands in the
command line and then a development database is created and is
seeded with data.

- It is done when the user enters the command to invoke the application
and then the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to
the MySQL database.

- It is done when the user opens the API GET routes in Insomnia for
categories, products, or tags and the data for each of these routes

data in the database.
